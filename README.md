Hi, this is my Machine Learning Recommendation System Project-Movielens for the Capstone. 

I had serious trouble with separate_row() function with this large dataset (10 millon rows). Always gave me " out of memory error", but I could do it. I did the project until "Regularized Movie + User effect model", which gave me the RMSE = 0.864817 that meets our goal: RMSE < 0.86490

To do some visualizations, I converted the Data Frames "edx" to Data Table, then I applied the function separate_rows (),
and after 2 hours the system gave me the perfectly separated genres, ready to be used. I decided to use Data Table
for separate_rows() function, since it worked faster in almost all the computations that I had to carry out and never indicated "memory error".
Note: after too much work and investigation, I decided install Microsoft R Open 3.5.3, and that allowed me to compute my project 10 times faster!!!
